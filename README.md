# Zendesk Support (Source)

This package models Zendesk Support data from [Fivetran's connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/zendesk). It uses data in the format described by [this ERD](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/zendesk#schemainformation).

This package enriches your Fivetran data by doing the following:

* Adds descriptions to tables and columns that are synced using Fivetran
* Adds column-level testing where applicable. For example, all primary keys are tested for uniqueness and non-null values.
* Models staging tables, which will be used in our transform package

## Models

This package contains staging models, designed to work simultaneously with our [Zendesk Support transformation package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_zendesk). The staging models name columns consistently across all packages:
* Boolean fields are prefixed with `is_` or `has_`
* Timestamps are appended with `_at`
* ID primary keys are prefixed with the name of the table. For example, the ticket table's ID column is renamed `ticket_id`.

## Installation Instructions
Check [dbt Hub](https://hub.getdbt.com/) for the latest installation instructions, or [read the dbt docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/package-management) for more information on installing packages.

Include in your `packages.yml`

```yaml
packages:
  - package: fivetran/zendesk_source
    version: [">=0.6.0", "<0.7.0"]
```

## Configuration
By default, this package looks for your Zendesk data in the `zendesk` schema of your [target database](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/running-a-dbt-project/using-the-command-line-interface/configure-your-profile). If this is not where your Zendesk Support data is, add the following configuration to your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
config-version: 2

vars:
    zendesk_schema: your_schema_name
    zendesk_database: your_database_name
```

### Adding Passthrough Columns
This package includes all source columns defined in the staging models. However, the `stg_zendesk__ticket` model allows for additional columns to be added using a pass-through column variable. This is extremely useful if you'd like to include custom fields to the package.
```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
vars:
  zendesk__ticket_passthrough_columns: [account_custom_field_1, account_custom_field_2]
```
### Changing the Build Schema
By default this package will build the Zendesk Support staging models within a schema titled (<target_schema> + `_zendesk_staging`) in your target database. If this is not where you would like you Zendesk Support staging data to be written to, add the following configuration to your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
models:
    zendesk_source:
        +schema: my_new_schema_name
```

### Disabling Models
This package takes into consideration that not every Zendesk account utilizes the `schedule`, `domain_name`, `user_tag`, `organization_tag`, or `ticket_form_history` features, and allows you to disable the corresponding functionality. By default, all variables' values are assumed to be `true`. Add variables for only the tables you want to disable:
```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
vars:
    using_schedules:            False         #Disable if you are not using schedules
    using_domain_names:         False         #Disable if you are not using domain names
    using_user_tags:            False         #Disable if you are not using user tags
    using_ticket_form_history:  False         #Disable if you are not using ticket form history
    using_organization_tags:    False         #Disable if you are not using organization tags
```
